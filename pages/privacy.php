  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>How we use your information </p>

  <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy notice tells you what to expect when Sharon Wray collects
    personal information. It applies to information we collect about: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>visitors to our websites;</li>
    <li>complainants and other individuals in relation to an enquiry;</li>
    <li>people who use our services; and</li>
    <li>job applicants and our current and former employees.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>We use information held about you in the following ways</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
    </li>
    <li>to provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest
      you,
      where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes;
    </li>
    <li>to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us;</li>
    <li>to notify you about changes to our service;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are an existing Customer, we will only contact you by electronic means with information about goods and
    services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you or our customer.</p>

  <p>We do not disclose personal information about individuals to advertisers or sell your information to any other
    organisation for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>Visitors to our websites</h2>
  <p>When someone visits our site we do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting
    our website. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be up front
    about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with
    it.</p>

  <h2>Use of cookies by Sharon Wray</h2>
  <p>You can read more about how we use cookies on our Cookie Policy page.</p>

  <h2>People who email us</h2>
  <p>Any email sent to us, including any attachments, may be monitored and used by us for reasons of security and for
    monitoring compliance with office policy. Email monitoring or blocking software may also be used. Please be aware
    that
    you have a responsibility to ensure that any email you send to us is within the bounds of the law.</p>

  <h2>People who make a complaint</h2>
  <p>When we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file containing the details of the complaint. This normally
    contains the identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved in the complaint.</p>

  <p>We will only use the personal information we collect to process the complaint and to check on the level of service
    we
    provide.</p>

  <p>We will keep personal information contained in complaint files in line with our retention policy. It will be
    retained
    in a secure environment and access to it will be restricted according to the ‘need to know’ principle.</p>

  <h2>People who enquire with us</h2>
  <p>Where enquiries are submitted to us we use the information supplied to process the enquiry. When consent is given,
    we
    will continue to contact the enquirer with information on services that we provide.</p>

  <p>We may retain personal information, in the form of names and email addresses, for direct marketing
    communications.</p>

  <p>Individuals can opt out of these communications at anytime by unsubscribing via a link included in emails or
    contacting us directly using the details at the end of this Policy.</p>

  <p>We will not share any personal data received through this method with 3rd parties.</p>

  <h2>People who use Sharon Wray’s services</h2>
  <p>Sharon Wray offers various services to the public.</p>

  <p>We have to hold the details of the people who have requested the service in order to provide it. However, we only
    use
    these details to provide the service the person has requested and for other closely related purposes. For example,
    we
    might use information about people who have subscribed to any of our services to carry out a survey to find out if
    they are happy with the level of service they received.</p>

  <p>When people do subscribe to our services, they can cancel their subscription at any time and are given an easy way
    of
    doing this. We do not store financial details of our clients (credit or debit card numbers).</p>

  <h2>Job applicants, current, and former Organisation employees</h2>
  <p>When individuals apply to work at Sharon Wray, we will only use the information they supply to us to process their
    application. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a
    reference
    or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the Criminal Records Bureau we will not do so without informing them beforehand unless
    the disclosure is required by law.</p>

  <p>Once a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to their employment. The information
    contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for purposes directly relevant to that person’s
    employment. Once their employment with us has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of
    our retention schedule and then delete it.</p>

  <h2>Disclosure of personal information</h2>
  <p>In many circumstances we will not disclose personal data without consent. However when we investigate a complaint,
    for example, we will need to share personal information with the organisation or individual concerned and with other
    relevant bodies.</p>

  <p>There are also circumstances where we can pass on personal data without consent for example, to prevent and detect
    crime and to produce anonymised statistics.</p>

  <h2>Access to personal information</h2>
  <p>The Organisation tries to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people access to their personal information.
    Individuals can find out if we hold any personal information by making a ‘subject access request’ under the General
    Data Protection Regulation. If we do hold information about you we will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>give you a description of it;</li>
    <li>tell you why we are holding it;</li>
    <li>tell you who it could be disclosed to; and</li>
    <li>let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To make a request to Sharon Wray for any personal information we may hold, you need to put the request in writing
    and
    either address it to us at the address provided below, or email us.</p>

  <p>If you agree, we will try to deal with your request informally, for example by providing you with the specific
    information you need over the telephone.</p>

  <p>If we do hold information about you, you can ask us to correct any mistakes by, once again, contacting us.</p>

  <p>As an individual, if you have issues accessing your personal information with any organisation you have the right
    to
    lodge a compliant with the ICO.</p>

  <p>Your Rights as a Data Subject:</p>

  <p>Right to Recification – the right to request us to rectify inaccurate personal data.</p>

  <p>Right to Object – the right to object to processing based on either public interests or legitimate interests.
    Processing must stop, unless we demonstrate compelling grounds for continuing the processing or that the processing
    is
    necessary in connection with our legal rights.</p>

  <p>Right to Object to Direct Marketing</p>

  <p>Right to be Forgotten – the right to have us erase personal data without undue delay. Contingent on the occurrence
    of
    one of the following: – The data is no longer necessary; – You withdraw your consent (where consent is our legal
    basis
    for processing); – We have no overriding grounds for continuing processing against the objectification; – Processing
    was unlawful; – Erasure is necessary with EU or national law.</p>

  <p>Right to Restrict Processing – the right to have us restrict processing if: – The accuracy of the data is
    contested;
    – Processing is unlawful; – We no longer need the data for its original purpose, but need it for legal purposes; –
    Erasure is pending.</p>

  <p>Right of Data Portability – the right to receive a copy of your data in a commonly used machine-readable format for
    transfer to another controller. This will either be in .xls or .csv format.</p>

  <p>The Organisation neither makes a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement nor engages in
    automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual. Hence your right related to
    automated decision making including profiling does not apply with us.</p>

  <p>Any formal subject access request should be made in writing to the address below. This will be provided free of
    charge. However we may charge a reasonable fee for repetitive, unfounded, or excessive requests or additional
    copies.</p>

  <h2>Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>Sharon Wray retains your information while you or your company remains an active client, unless you ask us to
    delete
    your information. If you stop being an active client we will retain your information for the periods defined in our
    retention policy unless you request that your details be deleted. However, we will only contact you if we believe
    the
    information we intend to send to you could be of ‘legitimate interest’ to you or your company.</p>

  <p>If you have signed up to receive our newsletter or requested information from us, we will retain your information
    until you request to be removed/deleted. Subject to the exceptions described below, Sharon Wray deletes or
    anonymizes
    your information when it’s reached the end of its retention period as per our policy or upon request from you. For
    further information regarding our retention periods and policy, please contact us via “email[link to email here]” or
    at the address provided at the end of this policy.</p>

  <p>Subject to applicable law, Sharon Wray may retain information after account deletion: – If there is an unresolved
    issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding invoice on your account. – If necessary for its legitimate
    business interests, such as fraud prevention. – If we are required to by applicable law; and/or in aggregated and/or
    anonymized form.</p>
