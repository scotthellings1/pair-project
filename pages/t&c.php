    <h2 class="tc-h2">Introduction</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    1. These terms and conditions set out the general terms under which we
    undertake our business. The specific conditions relating to particular
    assignments will be covered in separate letters of engagement.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Applicable law</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    2. These terms and conditions, our engagement letters, and the schedule of
    services are all governed by, and should be construed in accordance with
    English law. Each party agrees that the courts of England and Wales will have
    exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, dispute or difference
    concerning this engagement letter and any matter arising from it. Each party
    irrevocably waives any right to object to any action being brought in those
    Courts, to claim that the action has been brought in an inappropriate forum,
    or to claim that those Courts do not have jurisdiction.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Authorisation and registration</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    3. Green Accountancy Limited is registered with ACCA as chartered certified
    accountants and can be found on the register of members at
    http://fake-url.com.</p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    4. We are not registered as auditors.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    <h2 class="tc-h2">Bribery Act 2010</h2>
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    5. In accordance with the requirements of the Bribery Act 2010 we have
    policies and procedures in place to prevent the business and its partners and
    staff from offering or receiving bribes.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Client identification and verification</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    6. As with other professional services firms, we are required to identify and
    verify our clients for the purposes of the UK anti-money laundering
    legislation. Save in exceptional circumstances we cannot start work until
    this requirement has been met. We may request from you, and retain, such
    information and documentation as we require for these purposes and/or make
    searches of appropriate databases including ID verification software.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Client monies</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    7. We may, from time to time, hold money on your behalf. Such money will be
    held in trust in a client bank account, which is segregated from the
    firm&#8217;s funds. The account will be operated, and all funds dealt with,
    in accordance with the Clients&#8217; Monies Rules of the Association of
    Chartered Certified Accountants. These rules can be found on the ACCA website
    at http://www.accaglobal.com/en.html.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    8. We will return monies held on your behalf promptly as soon as there is no
    longer any reason to retain those funds. If any funds remain in our client
    account that are unclaimed and the client to which they relate has remained
    untraced for five years or we as a firm cease to practise then we may pay
    those monies to a registered charity.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    9. Fees paid by you in advance for professional work to be performed and
    clearly identifiable as such shall not be regarded as clients&#8217; monies.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Commissions or other benefits</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    10. In some circumstances, commissions or other benefits may become payable
    to us in respect of transactions which we arrange for you. Where this happens
    we will notify you in writing of the amount and terms of payment and receipt
    of any such commissions or benefits. The same will apply where the payment is
    made to or transactions are arranged by a person or business connected with
    ours. We will not reduce the fees we would otherwise charge by the amount of
    the commissions or benefits.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Confidentiality</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    11. Communication between us is confidential and we shall take all reasonable
    steps to keep confidential your information except where we are required to
    disclose it by law, by regulatory bodies, by our insurers or as part of an
    external peer review. Unless we are authorised by you to disclose
    information on your behalf this undertaking will apply during and after this
    engagement.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    12. We may, on occasions, subcontract work on your affairs to other tax,
    information technology or accounting professionals. The subcontractors will
    be bound by our client confidentiality terms.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Conflicts of interest</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    13. We will inform you if we become aware of any conflict of interest in our
    relationship with you or in our relationship with you and another client.
    Where conflicts are identified which cannot be managed in a way that protects
    your interests then we regret that we will be unable to provide further
    services. If this arises, we will inform you promptly. We reserve the right
    to act for other clients whose interests are not the same as or are adverse
    to yours, subject, of course, to the obligations of confidentiality referred
    to above.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    14. If there is a conflict of interest that is capable of being addressed
    successfully by the adoption of suitable safeguards to protect your interests
    then we will adopt those safeguards. Where possible this will be done on the
    basis of your informed consent. We reserve the right to act for other clients
    whose interests are not the same as or are adverse to yours subject of course
    to the obligations of confidentiality referred to above.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    15. The advice and information we provide to you as part of our service is
    for your sole use and not for any third party to whom you may communicate it
    unless we have expressly agreed in the Engagement letter that a specified
    third party may rely on our work. We accept no responsibility to third
    parties, including any group company to whom the engagement letter is not
    addressed, for any advice, information or material produced as part of our
    work for you which you make available to them. A party to this agreement is
    the only person who has the right under the Contracts (Rights of Third
    Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Data Protection</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    16. We confirm that we will comply with the provisions of the General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) when processing personal data about you, your
    directors and employees.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">Processing means:</p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    <ul>
      <li class="tc-li">

        (by any means) or removing (by any means) from the records manual and
        digital.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    17. The information we obtain, process, use and disclose will be necessary for:
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    <ul>
      <li class="tc-li">
        • the performance of the contract<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        • to comply with our legal and regulatory compliance and crime prevention<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        • contacting you with details of other services where you have consented to
        us doing so<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        • other legitimate interests relating to protection against potential claims
        and disciplinary action against us.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    This includes, but is not limited to, purposes such as updating and enhancing
    our client records, analysis for management purposes and statutory returns.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">18. In regard to our professional obligations we are a member firm of the
    Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). Under the ethical and
    regulatory rules of ACCA we am required to allow access to client files and
    records for the purpose of maintaining our membership of this body.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    19. Further details on the processing of data are contained in our privacy
    notice, which should be read alongside these terms and conditions.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Disengagement</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    20. Should we resign or be requested to resign we will normally issue a
    disengagement letter to ensure that our respective responsibilities are clear.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    21. Should we have no contact with you for a period of one year or more we
    may issue a disengagement letter and hence cease to act.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    22. We reserve the right following termination for any reason to destroy any
    of your documents that we have not been able to return to you after a period
    of six months unless other laws or regulations require otherwise.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Electronic and other communication</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    23. As instructed, we will communicate with you and with any third parties
    you instruct us to as set out in our covering letter and privacy notice via
    email or by other electronic means. The recipient is responsible for
    virus-checking emails and any attachments.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    24. With electronic communication there is a risk of non-receipt, delayed
    receipt, inadvertent misdirection or interception by third parties. We use
    virus-scanning software to reduce the risk of viruses and similar damaging
    items being transmitted through emails or electronic storage devices.
    However, electronic communication is not totally secure and we cannot be held
    responsible for damage or loss caused by viruses, nor for communications that
    are corrupted or altered after despatch. Nor can we accept any liability for
    problems or accidental errors relating to this means of communication,
    especially in relation to commercially sensitive material. These are risks
    you must accept in return for greater efficiency and lower costs. If you do
    not wish to accept these risks, please let us know and we will communicate by
    hard copy, other than where electronic submission is mandatory.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    25. Any communication by us with you sent through the post or DX system is
    deemed to arrive at your postal address two working days after the day that
    the document was sent.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    26. When accessing information held electronically by HMRC, we may have
    access to more information than we need and will only access records
    reasonably required to carry out the contract.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    27. You are required to keep us up to date with accurate contact details at
    all times. This is important to ensure that communications and papers are not
    sent to the incorrect address.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Ethical guidelines</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    28. We are bound by the ethical guidelines of the Association of Chartered
    Certified Accountants, and accept instructions to act for you on the basis
    that we will act in accordance with those ethical guidelines. A copy of these
    guidelines can be viewed at our offices on request or can be seen at
    www.accaglobal.com. We will not be liable for any loss, damage or cost
    arising from our compliance with statutory or regulatory obligations.
  </p>

    <h2 class="tc-h2">Fees</h2>

  <p class="tc-p">
    29. Our fees may depend not only upon the time spent on your affairs but also
    on the level of skill and responsibility and the importance and value of the
    advice that we provide, as well as the level of risk.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    30. If we provide you with an estimate of our fees for any specific work,
    then the estimate will not be contractually binding unless we explicitly
    state that that will be the case.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    31. Fixed fee quotations
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    <ul>
      <li class="tc-li">
        a) We may indicate a fixed fee for the provision of specific services or an
        indicative range of fees for a particular assignment. All fee quotations are
        valid for 30 days.<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        b) It is not our practice to identify fixed fees for more than a year ahead
        as such fee quotes need to be reviewed in the light of events.<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        c) If it becomes apparent to us, due to unforeseen circumstances, that a fee
        quote is inadequate, we reserve the right to notify you of a revised figure
        or range and to seek your agreement thereto.<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        d) All fixed fees are quoted based on you or your bookkeeper accurately
        recording all transactions in our spreadsheet or on any recognised
        bookkeeping system. This means that all bank balances, assets and
        liabilities are recorded accurately within your bookkeeping system.<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        e) Fixed fees do not include bookkeeping. If your bookkeeping is not complete
        and accurate, or if your bookkeeping does not give a trial balance for us to
        work from, it will be necessary for us to carry out some bookkeeping prior to
        preparing VAT returns, management accounts or year-end accounts. Bookkeeping
        will be charged at our prevailing rates per hour depending on the level of
        skill required for the work. This will be invoiced soon after carrying out
        such work in addition to any fixed fee quoted.<br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        f) Fixed fees do not include resolving problems, correcting work or
        recalculating work that has been carried out by you or your previous agents
        for past years. If it is found such work is required we would discuss the
        situation and additional fees with you prior to carrying out any such work.
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li class="tc-li">
        g) When preparing accounts under a fixed fee arrangement we will make one set
        of amendments you require, and issue one full set of revised accounts and tax
        returns with no additional charge. If further information is provided after
        we have prepared the revised accounts we will charge a minimum of 20% of the
        annual fee for such amendments and providing further revised accounts. It is
        recommended that you provide full information relating to your business and
        income prior to us carrying out any accounting work.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    32. In some cases, you may be entitled to assistance with your professional
    fees, particularly in relation to any investigation into your tax affairs by
    HMRC. Assistance may be provided through insurance policies you hold or via
    membership of a professional or trade body. Other than where such a service
    was arranged through us you will need to advise us of any such insurance
    cover that you have. You will remain liable for our fees regardless of
    whether all or part are liable to be paid by your insurers.
  </p>
  <p class="tc-p">
    33. Our fee arrangements and quotations may include Support. The type, scope
    and quantity of work included as support may be varied at any time by us and
    is entirely at our discretion and may be defined on an individual basis by
    us. Support does not include advice, carrying out research, or carrying out
    analysis.
